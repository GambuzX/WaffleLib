# WaffleLib
Window system and manager for Minix 3 developed as the final project for LCOM.

* **Timer**
* **Keyboard**
* **Mouse**
* **Video card**
* **Real time clock**
* **Serial port**

#### Project Grade: ?

### Description

This repository includes the source code of our program and the report in which we explain in detail all of the program's nuances and features.

**WaffleLib** references the Library we created to manage the graphical environment and all its elements, handling the peripherals and updating its state accordingly.

**ChocoTab** is the graphical environment created using WaffleLib.

In the Desktop appear the real folders from */home*, a taskbar and a clock. The taskbar has a *menu button* that, once clicked, displays more options. These are the multiple *programs* which we developed to show the *WaffleLib* capabilites, listed below. Opening a program creates a new window for it, which can be moved, closed, minimized and some of them maximized.

#### Programs in ChocoTab
* Background Chooser 
* Calculator
* Chatter\*
* Example App
* File Browser
* Guess Painter\*
* Login
* Multi Painter\*
* Painter
* System Info

\* Includes multiplayer features
